    A network is a structure created for the purpose of sharing data and resources, establishing communication, and enabling collaboration among interconnected electronic devices such as computers, mobile devices, and other hardware.

How does it work? Networks enable these devices to communicate with each other through specific communication protocols and software-based components.

What is its purpose? Networks support various functions such as connecting to the internet, file and printer sharing, email communication, database access, and web services. Additionally, networks often include elements such as data security, management, and monitoring.

<h1 align='center'>What is a Host?</h1>

<p>
    A host refers to any device on a network capable of data communication and interaction with other devices. Computers, servers, printers, routers, smart devices, and other network devices can all be considered hosts. Hosts can share data with each other, communicate, and perform various tasks on the network.
</p>

Hosts have features, including the following:

    Communication Capability: Hosts can communicate with other devices on the network. This communication can take various forms, such as data exchange, file sharing, printer sharing, and sending emails.
    Addressing: Each host has a unique identifier on the network. This identifier can be a network address like an IP address or a name like a host name. Addressing allows hosts to be recognized on the network and to communicate with other devices.
    Functionality: Hosts are usually designed to perform specific functions. For example, servers can provide websites or file storage services, while computers are used for general-purpose computing and tasks.

<h1 align='center'>What are Server and Client?</h1>

<h1 align='center'>What is a Server?</h1>

A server is a computer or hardware device that provides specific services and serves clients on a network. A server is typically a high-performance and powerful computer that operates continuously. There are various types of servers, such as web servers, email servers, and file servers. For example, a web server hosts websites and allows users to access them over the internet. An email server enables email communication and allows users to send and receive emails.
<h1 align='center'>What is a Client?</h1>

A client is a computer or hardware device that connects to servers on a network to access services. Clients are typically user-controlled and managed devices. Clients request services from servers and use the services provided by the servers. For example, a web browser connects to a web server to retrieve web pages and display them to the user. An email client connects to an email server to display incoming and outgoing emails.

Note: While server and client concepts often seem like fixed roles defined in a particular communication or service environment, these roles can sometimes change or blur. In distributed systems or peer-to-peer communication protocols, a device can act as a server at one moment while serving files, and then as a client at another moment while downloading files from other devices. This flexibility allows systems to operate more effectively and efficiently and enables dynamic distribution of functions.

In summary:
Servers and clients are two fundamental components of modern networks. Servers provide services and serve clients, while clients access these services by connecting to servers. Understanding these concepts is essential for anyone who wants to comprehend and utilize internet and network technologies.
